# Email Whitelabeling

1. Create a Sendgrid account
2. Verify either a single sender or a domain: you will need access to your DNS host account to verify a domain (GoDaddy, Google Cloud, Cloudflare etc.)
3. Go to [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys); and generate an API key; save this key somewhere
4. Sign-in to Scenes community with owner account and go to settings >> Whitelabel Email
5. Enter the API key you saved from step 3;
6. If you verified a single sender in step 2: enter the same email address in the “Sender email address” field; If you verified a domain in step 2: enter any email address with that domain name.
